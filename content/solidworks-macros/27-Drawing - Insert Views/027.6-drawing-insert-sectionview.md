## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Insert Section View*.

```vb
Option Explicit

' Creating variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Creating variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc

' Creating variable for Solidworks View
Dim insertView As SldWorks.View

' Program to Insert Section View
Sub main()

  ' Setting Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Set Solidworks Drawing document variable
  Set swDrawing = swDoc
  
  ' Insert Section View
  Set insertView = swDrawing.CreateSectionViewAt5(0.2, 0.12, 0, "A", swCreateSectionView_NotAligned, Nothing, 0)
  
  ' Check if we successfully insert Section view
  If insertView Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Failed to Insert Section View."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Rebuild document
  swDoc.ForceRebuild3 False

End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ❗***required***.
* We create **Section view** from an existing (Base) view .
* We already select a line as "**Section Line**" this existing (Base) view.

[![prerequisite](drawing-insert-sectionview/prerequisite.png)](drawing-insert-sectionview/prerequisite.png)

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Variables*
3. *Insert Section Views*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon 🚀)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Drawing*.
* **Variable Name**: `swDrawing`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.DrawingDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks View
Dim insertView As SldWorks.View
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks View*.
* **Variable Name**: `insertView`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.View`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IView_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb
' Program to Insert Section View
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *Program to Insert Section View*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Variables

In this section, we initialize Variables.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Drawing document
Set swDrawing = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

### Insert Section Views

In this section, we *Insert Section Views* action.

```vb 
' Insert Section View
Set insertView = swDrawing.CreateSectionViewAt5(0.2, 0.12, 0, "A", swCreateSectionView_NotAligned, Nothing, 0)
```

* In above code, we **Insert Section View** into Drawing.
* For this, we use **`CreateSectionViewAt5`** method.
* This **`CreateSectionViewAt5`** method is part of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This method takes following parameters.
  * **X**: *X position on the drawing sheet for the center of the section view.*
  * **Y**: *Y position on the drawing sheet for the center of the section view.*
  * **Z**: *Z position on the drawing sheet for the center of the section view.*
  * **SectionLabel**: *Letter for the label for the section view.*
  * **Options**: *Options that affect the section view as defined in **`swCreateSectionViewAtOptions_e`** as following.*

    | Parameter Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                           |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **swCreateSectionView_ChangeDirection**   | `If set, then the direction of this section view is switched; if not set, then the direction of this section view is not switched.`                   |
    | **swCreateSectionView_CutSurfaceBodies**  | `If set, then shows only the intersecting line of a surface in a section.`                                                                            |
    | **swCreateSectionView_DisplaySurfaceCut** | `If set, then only the surfaces cut by the section line apear in the section view; if not set, then all model surfaces appear in the section view.`   |
    | **swCreateSectionView_ExcludeFasteners**  | `If set, then fasteners are not included in the section view; if not set, then fasteners are included in the section view.`                           |
    | **swCreateSectionView_NotAligned**        | `If set, then the section does not snap into alignment with the parent view; if not set, then the section snaps into alignment with the parent view.` |
    | **swCreateSectionView_OffsetSection**     | `If set, then an aligned section view is created (two lines at an angle); if not set, a normal projection section view is created.`                   |
    | **swCreateSectionView_Partial**           | `If set, then a partial section view is created; if not set, then a complete section view is created.`                                                |
    | **swCreateSectionView_ScaleWithModel**    | `If set, then the section view is scaled with the model; if not set, then the section view is not scaled with the model.`                             |

  * **ExcludedComponents**: *Array of components to exclude from the section view.*

```vb
' Check if we successfully insert view
If insertView Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox "Failed to Insert Section View"
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully insert views or not.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`insertView Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to Insert Section View.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Rebuild drawing
swDoc.ForceRebuild3 True
```

* In above line, we Rebuild drawing.
* For this we use `ForceRebuild3` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we show selected component as shown in below image.
