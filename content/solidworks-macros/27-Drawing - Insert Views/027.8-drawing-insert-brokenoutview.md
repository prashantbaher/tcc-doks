## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Insert Broken-out View*.

```vb
Option Explicit

' Creating variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Creating variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc

' Program to Insert Broken-out View
Sub main()

  ' Setting Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Set Solidworks Drawing document variable
  Set swDrawing = swDoc
  
  ' Boolean variable
  Dim boolStatus As Boolean
  
  ' Insert Broken-out View
  boolStatus = swDrawing.CreateBreakOutSection(0.1)
  
  ' Check if we successfully insert Broken-out View
  If boolStatus = False Then
    MsgBox "Failed to Insert Broken-out View."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Rebuild drawing
  swDoc.ForceRebuild3 False

End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ❗***required***.
* We create **Broken-out view** from an *existing (Base) view*.
* We already select a **Circle** in this *existing (Base) view*.

[![prerequisite](drawing-brokenout-view/prerequisite.png)](drawing-brokenout-view/prerequisite.png)

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Variables*
3. *Insert Broken-out Views*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon 🚀)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Drawing*.
* **Variable Name**: `swDrawing`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.DrawingDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb
' Program to Insert Broken-out View
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *Program to Insert Broken-out View*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Variables

In this section, we initialize Variables.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Drawing document
Set swDrawing = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

### Insert Broken-out Views

In this section, we *Insert Broken-out Views*.

```vb
' Boolean variable
Dim boolStatus As Boolean
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a **`Boolean`** variable.
* **Variable Name**: `boolStatus`
* **Type**: `Boolean`

```vb 
' Insert Broken-out View
boolStatus = swDrawing.CreateBreakOutSection(0.1)
```

* In above code, we **Insert Broken-out View** into Drawing.
* For this, we use **`CreateBreakOutSection`** method.
* This **`CreateBreakOutSection`** method is part of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This method takes following parameters.
  * **Depth**: *X position for the Detail view.*

* **Return Value** : This **`CreateBreakOutSection`** method return **`True`** if the broken-out section was created, **`False`** if not.

* In our code, I have used following values:

  | Parameter Name | Value Used |
  | -------------- | ---------- |
  | **Depth**      | `0.1`      |

* **Reference**: For more details please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks~solidworks.interop.sldworks.idrawingdoc~CreateBreakOutSection.html)**.

```vb
' Check if we successfully insert Broken-out View
If boolStatus = False Then
  MsgBox "Failed to Insert Broken-out View."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully insert views or not.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`boolStatus = False`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to Insert Broken-out View.
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Rebuild drawing
swDoc.ForceRebuild3 True
```

* In above line, we Rebuild drawing.
* For this we use `ForceRebuild3` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we show selected component as shown in below image.
