## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Variables*
3. *Update Break line Type*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon 🚀)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Drawing*.
* **Variable Name**: `swDrawing`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.DrawingDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks View
Dim swView As SldWorks.View
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks View*.
* **Variable Name**: `swView`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.View`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IView_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks Breakline
Dim swBreakLine As SldWorks.BreakLine
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Breakline*.
* **Variable Name**: `swBreakLine`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.BreakLine`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IBreakLine_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb
' Program to Update Break line type
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *Program to Update Break line type*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Variables

In this section, we initialize Variables.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Drawing document
Set swDrawing = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

```vb
' Get activate view
Set swView = swDrawing.ActiveDrawingView
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swView`** variable.
* This value is currently selected view.
* We get value by **`ActiveDrawingView`** method.
* This **`ActiveDrawingView`** method is part of **`swDrawing`** variable.


```vb
' Check if view is selected or not
If swView Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox "No view selected."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully get the value of **`swView`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swView Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *No view selected.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

### Update Break line position

In this section, we *Update Break line position*.

```vb 
' Variable for Break lines
Dim breaks As Variant
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for getting *Break lines* from current views.
* **Variable Name**: `breaks`
* **Type**: `Variant`

```vb 
' Get Break lines in current view
breaks = swView.GetBreakLines
```

* In above code, we **get Break lines** in current view.
* Then we set the value of **`breaks`** variable.
* For this, we use **`GetBreakLines`** method.
* This **`GetBreakLines`** method is part of **`swView`** variable.
* This method did not take any parameter.
* **Return Value** : This **`GetBreakLines`** method returns **Solidworks Break line**.
* **Reference**: For more details please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2021/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks~solidworks.interop.sldworks.iview~getbreaklines.html)**.

```vb
' Get first break line and set Solidworks Breakline variable
Set swBreakLine = breaks(0)
```

* In above line, we get first break line.
* Then we set the value of Solidworks Breakline variable **`swBreakLine`**.

```vb 
' Set Straight Line style
swBreakLine.Style = swBreakLineStyle_e.swBreakLine_Straight
```

* In above code, we **Set Straight Line style**.
* For this, we use **`Style`** property.
* This **`Style`** property is part of **`swBreakLine`** variable.
* We set the value of this **`Style`** property to value of **`swBreakLineStyle_e.swBreakLine_Straight`** variable.
* **`swBreakLineStyle_e`** has multiple values for different styles as explained below.

  - **Type** - *Type of Styles are defined in **`swBreakLineStyle_e`***:

    | Member                        | Description |
    | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
    | **`swBreakLine_Curve`**       | *3*         |
    | **`swBreakLine_Jagged`**      | *5*         |
    | **`swBreakLine_SmallZigZag`** | *4*         |
    | **`swBreakLine_Straight`**    | *1*         |
    | **`swBreakLine_ZigZag`**      | *2*         |

* You can select type of style from above values as per requirement.

```vb
' Rebuild drawing
swDoc.ForceRebuild3 True
```

* In above line, we Rebuild drawing.
* For this we use `ForceRebuild3` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e **`swDoc`** variable.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we show selected component as shown in below image.
