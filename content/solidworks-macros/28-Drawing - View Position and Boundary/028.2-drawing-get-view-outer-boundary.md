## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Get View Outer Boundary*.

```vb
Option Explicit

' Creating variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Creating variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc

' Creating variable for Solidworks View
Dim swView As SldWorks.View

' Program to Get View Outer Boundary
Sub main()

  ' Setting Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Set Solidworks Drawing document variable
  Set swDrawing = swDoc
  
  ' Get activate view
  Set swView = swDrawing.ActiveDrawingView
  
  ' Variable for view's outline position
  Dim viewOutlinePosition() As Double

  ' Get view's outline position
  viewOutlinePosition = swView.GetOutline

  ' Print view's outline position co-ordinates
  Debug.Print "View's Left X: " & viewOutlinePosition(0)
  Debug.Print "View's Right X: " & viewOutlinePosition(2)
  
  Debug.Print "View's Bottom Y: " & viewOutlinePosition(1)
  Debug.Print "View's Top Y: " & viewOutlinePosition(3)

End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ❗***required***.
* We get view outer boundary from an *existing (Base) view*.
* We already select an *existing (Base) view*.

[![prerequisite](drawing-get-view-outer-boundary/prerequisite.png)](drawing-get-view-outer-boundary/prerequisite.png)

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Variables*
3. *Get View Outer Boundary*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon 🚀)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks Drawing
Dim swDrawing As SldWorks.DrawingDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Drawing*.
* **Variable Name**: `swDrawing`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.DrawingDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IDrawingDoc_members.html)**.

```vb
' Creating variable for Solidworks View
Dim swView As SldWorks.View
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks View*.
* **Variable Name**: `swView`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.View`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IView_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb
' Program to Get View Outer Boundary
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *Program to Get View Outer Boundary*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Variables

In this section, we initialize Variables.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Drawing document
Set swDrawing = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDrawing`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

### Get View Outer Boundary

In this section, we *Get View Outer Boundary*.

```vb
' Get activate view
Set swView = swDrawing.ActiveDrawingView
```

* In above code, we **Get activate view** from Drawing.
* For this, we use **`ActiveDrawingView`** property.
* This **`ActiveDrawingView`** property is part of **`swDrawing`** variable.

```vb
' Variable for view's outline position
Dim viewOutlinePosition() As Double
```

* In above line, we create an **Array** variable for view's outline position.
* **Variable Name**: `viewOutlinePosition()`
* **Type**: `Double`

```vb
' Get view's outline position
viewOutlinePosition = swView.GetOutline
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`viewOutlinePosition`** variable.
* We set the value by **`GetOutline()`** method of **`swView`** variable.

```vb
' Print view's outline position co-ordinates
Debug.Print "View's Left X: " & viewOutlinePosition(0)
Debug.Print "View's Right X: " & viewOutlinePosition(2)

Debug.Print "View's Bottom Y: " & viewOutlinePosition(1)
Debug.Print "View's Top Y: " & viewOutlinePosition(3)
```

* In above line, we **Print** selected View's outline position co-ordinates in **Immediate Window**.
* If **Immediate Window** is not available then press "**`Ctrl + G`**".
* View's Left X: **`viewOutlinePosition(0)`** ⬅ This is **0th** index.
* View's Right X: **`viewOutlinePosition(2)`** ⬅ This is **2nd** index.
* View's Bottom Y: **`viewOutlinePosition(1)`** ⬅ This is **1st** index.
* View's Top Y: **`viewOutlinePosition(3)`** ⬅ This is **3rd** index.

Please see below image for more details.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we **Get View Outer Boundary** as shown in below image.
