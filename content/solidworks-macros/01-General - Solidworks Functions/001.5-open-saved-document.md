In this post, I tell you how to *open a saved document* in Solidworks using *VBA Macro*.

We open document with 2 different methods.

1. By `OpenDoc` method  
2. By `OpenDoc6` method

## Video of Code on YouTube

Please see below video on **how to Open Saved Documents** from Visual Studio.

Please note that there are **no explaination** in the video. 

**Explaination** of each line and why we write code this way is given in this post.

## By OpenDoc method

This is **the simplest** method to open a saved part from your computer.

In this method we just need two information:

- Location of document to open  
- Type of document which we want to open

Below is the example code for opening a saved document using `OpenDoc` method.

{{< tabs "vba-code" >}}
{{< tab "vba" >}}
```vb {lineNos=true}
Option Explicit

' Creating variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
' Creating variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean

' Main function of our VBA program
Sub main()

  ' Setting Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
      
  ' Open a saved document
  Set swDoc = swApp.OpenDoc("H:\Solidworks studies\API Studies\Chapter 1 - The Basics\1st example part.SLDPRT", swDocumentTypes_e.swDocPART)
      
  ' Selecting Front Plane
  BoolStatus = swDoc.SelectByID("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0)

End Sub
````

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

I have already explained every line except *middle line* in above code sample in previous posts.

To open a saved document we used following line:

{{< tabs "vba-code" >}}
{{< tab "vba" >}}

```vb {lineNos=true}
' Open a saved document
Set swDoc = swApp.OpenDoc("H:\Solidworks studies\API Studies\Chapter 1 - The Basics\1st example part.SLDPRT", swDocumentTypes_e.swDocPART)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Here, we set the `ModelDoc2` variable `swDoc` to a value.

This value is *return* or *provided* by `OpenDoc` method.

This method is part of *Solidworks document*.

Since we define `swApp` variable as Solidworks document hence we first call `swApp` and then using `Dot operator` we access the `OpenDoc` method.

`OpenDoc` method takes 2 *arguments* or *parameters*.

* **FileName**: Document name or full path if not in current directory, including extension.
* **Type**: Document type as defined in `swDocumentTypes_e` as follows:

  * `swDocASSEMBLY`
  * `swDocDRAWING`
  * `swDocLAYOUT`
  * `swDocNONE`
  * `swDocPART`
  * `swDocSDM`

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
If you want to open a Library feature part then we use `swDocPART` as document type.
{{< /callout >}}

**Return Value** — If the document opens then this method returns `True`, otherwise `False`.

If you just want to open a saved document then this method is what you are looking for.

For most of the part, `OpenDoc` method works well.

If you want more options while opening a document, then next method is for you.

## By OpenDoc6 method

`OpenDoc6` method is an extension to `OpenDoc` with some additional parameters.

How `OpenDoc6` works is shown in below code sample:

{{< tabs "vba-code" >}}
{{< tab "vba" >}}

```vb {lineNos=true}
Option Explicit

' Creating variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
' Creating variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean

' Main function of our VBA program
Sub main()

    ' Setting Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
        
    ' Open an saved document
    Set swDoc = swApp.OpenDoc6("H:\Solidworks studies\API Studies\Chapter 1 - The Basics\1st example part.SLDPRT", swDocumentTypes_e.swDocPART, swOpenDocOptions_e.swOpenDocOptions_Silent, "", 0, 0)
        
    ' Selecting Front Plane
    BoolStatus = swDoc.SelectByID("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0)

End Sub
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

This code sample is similar to the previous example code except for the fact that `OpenDoc6` method takes extra 4 parameters.

`OpenDoc6` method takes 6 *arguments* or *parameters*.

* **FileName**: Document name or full path if not in current directory, including extension.
* **Type**: Document type as defined in `swDocumentTypes_e` as follows:

  * `swDocASSEMBLY`
  * `swDocDRAWING`
  * `swDocLAYOUT`
  * `swDocNONE`
  * `swDocPART`
  * `swDocSDM`

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
If you want to open a Library feature part then we use `swDocPART` as document type.
{{< /callout >}}

* **Options**: Mode in which to open the document as defined in `swOpenDocOptions_e`.

  For more details about *Options* parameters, please visit 🚀 **{{< target-blank "this page of Solidworks API Help" "https://help.solidworks.com/2025/english/api/swconst/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swOpenDocOptions_e.html" >}}**.

* **Configuration**: Configuration in which you want to open this document.

  * Applies to *Part* and *Assemblies*, not *Drawings*.
  * If this argument is *empty* or the specified configuration is *not present* in the model, the model is opened in the last-used configuration.

I used an `""` in the above code sample, because I want to open part file in last saved configuration.

If you don't know about `""`, then this symbol represents an **empty string**.

When we don't want to pass any value as `string`, at that time we use `""`.

You can also use `""` when you want to pass an empty string in VBA.

* **Errors**: Load errors as defined in `swFileLoadError_e`.

  For more details about *Errors* parameters, please visit 🚀 **{{< target-blank "this page of Solidworks API Help" "http://help.solidworks.com/2025/english/api/swconst/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swFileLoadError_e.html" >}}**.

Since this parameter is of `Long` type, and I don't want to enter any value from the provided list, I used **0** as value.

If you want to use options from the option link then you can use values from there.

It is just I don't want to load any error information about the part.

* **Warnings**: Warnings or extra information generated during the open operation as defined in `swFileLoadWarning_e`.

  For more details about *Warnings* parameters, please visit 🚀 **{{< target-blank "this page of Solidworks API Help" "http://help.solidworks.com/2025/english/api/swconst/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swFileLoadWarning_e.html" >}}**.

As in the previous parameter, I use **0** as value.

**Return Value** — If the document opens then this method returns `True`, otherwise `False`.

As you can see, in `OpenDoc6` method, we need to define the extra parameters compared to `OpenDoc` method.

It is worth noting that, `OpenDoc6` method is the most updated method for opening a saved document.

Hence if you did not use any of the above methods, I would recommend you to use `OpenDoc6` method.
