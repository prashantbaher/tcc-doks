👋 Hi, I'm Prashant — The CAD Coder

I'm a **Lead Software Developer** in the IT department of a mechanical‑engineering company.  
Before that, I spent **8 years as a SolidWorks design engineer**, so I know exactly where real‑world CAD workflows bog down.

Since 2019 I’ve been automating those bottlenecks with **C#**, **VBA**, **WPF**, and the **SolidWorks API** (and lately the **Autodesk Inventor API**).  
*The CAD Coder* exists so other engineers can skip the trial‑and‑error I went through.

## 💡 Why I Started The CAD Coder

Most CAD‑automation tutorials are outdated, incomplete, or ignore production realities.  
This site fixes that by:

- Teaching macros that solve actual engineering problems  
- Sharing production‑ready code I use at work  
- Bridging the gap between CAD users and developer‑grade automation

---

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here

- **SolidWorks C# tutorials** (WPF + MVVM)  
- **Reusable code snippets** and full walkthrough videos  
- **Legacy VBA scripts** where they still make sense  
- Practical tips to cut hours of repetitive CAD work

## 🚀 Start Here

- 👉 [Browse SolidWorks C# Tutorials](/Solidworks-csharp-api-tutorials/)  
- 👉 [Check out my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_VglqA2S4WUXM55vyqAFg)  
- [🎁 Download 5 Free SolidWorks Macros →](https://gitlab.com/prashantbaher/the-cad-coder-updated/-/raw/main/Files/starter-pack.zip?ref_type=heads&inline=false)

Cut hours of repetitive work with real macros I use daily —  
for drawing export, renaming files, and updating properties.

If you’re tired of exporting, renaming, or updating properties by hand, you’re in the right place.  
Let’s automate that work away together — and if you build something cool from what you learn here, **tell me about it**.
