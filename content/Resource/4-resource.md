## 📘 Learning VBA for Excel & SolidWorks

### Book: *Excel Macros for Dummies*

Great for learning VBA from scratch. It helped me understand the core syntax and build confidence with macros.

🛒 [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119518172?tag=thecadcoder91-20)

🎓 Prefer not to buy? No worries! You can also check out my [VBA tutorials here](/vba/vba-Introduction/).

A practical, beginner-friendly channel to get started with SolidWorks macros.

📚 Want more? I write detailed tutorials on [SolidWorks VBA Macros](/Solidworks-macro-guide/) on this blog.

### Book: *Automating SolidWorks 2025 Using Macros*

While I haven’t personally read this, it’s one of the few books on macro automation that’s up-to-date.

## ⚙️ Learning C++ (for SolidWorks API)

### Books by Bjarne Stroustrup

1. [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321992784?tag=thecadcoder-20) — best for beginners.
2. [The C++ Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321958322?tag=thecadcoder-20) — more advanced.

> I suggest starting with *Programming: Principles and Practice* — it teaches how to think like a programmer.

📌 There's very little SolidWorks C++ API material online. But I’ve created some small apps and may share those soon.

## 🎁 Bonus: My Debugging Toolkit

Here’s what I do when I get stuck:

### 🔍 SolidWorks Offline Help

Still my most-used reference. If web help doesn’t open, go to:

* `Help` → uncheck *Use SOLIDWORKS Web Help*
* Go to `API Help`
* Use the `Index` tab to search topics (e.g., *hole wizard*)

> Tip: Look at the built-in sample code. It often solves 80% of your problem.

### 🌐 Google Like a Pro

Search like this:

> *"How to open Excel in SolidWorks VBA"*

This usually leads me to forum answers, even without logging in.

### 💬 SolidWorks Forum

Search before asking. If your question is unique, post it — the community is helpful (especially for macros).

### 💡 StackOverflow

Perfect for language-specific issues in C#, VBA, or WPF. Even without an account, I often find solutions here.
