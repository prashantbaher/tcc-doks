Hello all,

As mentioned in previous article, I need to learn some topics for my work.

One of those topics is Wix4 Toolset.

In this article we understand

- Why Wix?
- What is Wix?
- How to install Wix4 Toolset?


## Why Wix

Wix is used for creating MSI packages.

As you know, MSI packages are reponsible for installing software into our Windows machine.

We already had **Visual Studio Installer package**.

But for some of our requirements I need to learn about it.

If you browse internet for *Wix4 tutorials*, there are very few.

So for my future purpose, I want to write what I have learnt from various place into my website.
