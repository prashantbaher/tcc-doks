Welcome to the **CAD Coder Knowledge Base** — a curated collection of my technical learnings, experiments, and solutions.  
As a CAD Engineer turned Automation Developer, I’ve faced many struggles: lack of beginner-friendly material, poor documentation, and scattered knowledge across forums.

This section of the site aims to fix that.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Knowledge Base

This is not a traditional blog.

Here, I document the **core technical knowledge** I’ve gained, in a structured and reusable format.  
You’ll find:

- Concept breakdowns  
- XML/WiX and SolidWorks macro examples  
- Practical insights from my own projects  
- Minimal fluff — only what actually works in real-world CAD automation

---

## 👤 Who This Is For

This is built for:

- Mechanical Engineers transitioning into programming
- Developers working with **SolidWorks**, **WPF**, or **WiX**
- Engineers trying to automate daily tasks using **VBA** or **C#**
- Anyone tired of copy-pasting macros and wants to **understand** how things work

If you’re one of them — welcome home.

## 🧱 How It’s Structured

The knowledge base is divided into sections based on tools and platforms I use daily:

### 📂 SolidWorks VBA Macros

Step-by-step automation with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for SolidWorks.

👉 [Start Learning VBA Macros →](/vba/vba-introduction/)

---

### 💻 C# + SolidWorks API

Modern automation using the SolidWorks API with C# and .NET. This includes macro development, standalone apps, and more.

### ⚙️ WiX Installer Projects

How to build professional Windows installers using **WiX Toolset** — with XML configurations, desktop icons, program entries, and more.

### 🛠️ Programming Essentials for Engineers

Lessons I’ve learned about how to think like a programmer, debug, and write code as a non-CS-background engineer.

👉 Coming Soon…

## 🔄 This Page Will Evolve

Like engineering itself, this page is **iterative**.  
As I learn, build, and test more things, I’ll update this section with:

- New sections
- Updated code samples
- Deeper guides based on reader feedback

## 📬 Want More?

If you want updates when I publish something new, join the mailing list (coming soon) or just bookmark this page.

Let’s build tools that work — and understand how they’re built.

🧠 Stay curious. Stay building.
